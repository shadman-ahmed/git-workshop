# Git-Workshop

I have tried to showcase a few git commands, which might help you to get out of sticky situations. For example, you did a hard reset and you want to revert that, or you want to recover a deleted branch. Add files to the last commit, or undo an old commit.

Please follow along with the **instruction file** to learn about the git commands to aid you in those situations.
