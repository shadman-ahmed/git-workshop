# git reflog - reference log (time machine)

[Description]
Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other 
references were updated in the local repository.

[Instruction]
[Example #1]
1. git checkout -b 'delete-me'  # creates a branch delete-me and moves to it
2. touch file                   # creates a file
3. git add file                 # adds the file to staging area
4. git commit -m "add file"     # saves the file 
5. git reset --hard HEAD~1      # resets 1 commit
6. git reflog                   # shows git history. You are to track sha for 
                                # add file commit
7. git reset <sha-add-file>     # recovers the sha snapshot
8. undo unstaged changes        # remove unstaged file changes due to hard reset

[Example #2]
1. git checkout reflog
2. git branch -D 'delete-me' - (should show the tip sha for delete-me branch) 
3. git reflog - track last sha of delete-me branch
4. git checkout -b 'delete-me' <delete-me-tip-sha>
